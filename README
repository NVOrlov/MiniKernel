MiniKernel is a small i386 operating system kernel written in FASM
Kernel is still in development, and only these features are completed:
- bootloader
- i386 protected mode
- printing routins
- higher half kernel
- interrupts (including routins for fake interrupts handling)
- timer
For the next release:
- ATA driver
- FAT

To build and test kernel with bochs:
fasm main.asm
bochs -f config.cfg

Thank you for your attention to this little project!
